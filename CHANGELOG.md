# Changelog

All notable changes to Qobuz Librarian are recorded here, newest first. The project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); dates are when each version was tagged during local development.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-24

**Web UI**

- Search now respects your library. Albums you already own are marked "In library" with a quiet "Download again" instead of a plain Download button, so search stops inviting you to re-grab music you have — it uses the same owned-album match the scans do. The whole app is gap-fill, and an unconditional Download on an owned album contradicted that.
- A review now completes the moment you dismiss its last album. Before, hiding everything left the job stuck "awaiting review" over an empty list and kept a stale new-release banner on the dashboard that read "0 new releases"; the banner is now also gated on a non-zero count so it can never read zero again.
- "New releases" now means recently released. The check was a plain catalog diff, so an old album Qobuz back-filled into an artist's catalog got flagged as new — a 2020 album could show up as a "new release". It now only surfaces albums released within a recency window (`NEW_RELEASE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, default 365 days; 0 disables it). Gap-fill still surfaces old albums you're missing, as before.
- The search box is one clean bar again — the input and button are joined at every width — instead of a small field above an oversized full-width button on phones.
- Decluttered the dashboard: dropped the marketing tagline and the quick-action tiles that just duplicated the nav, so it leads straight with search and recent activity.
- Finish fixes: the hidden-albums list no longer crushes the artist name to "R…" on a phone, history result lines wrap instead of clipping, and a few headers stack cleanly on small screens.
- A failed download now says what actually went wrong — tracks failed, downloaded-but-import-failed, or nothing retrieved (Qobuz rate-limiting or an unavailable release, try again) — instead of the catch-all "download or import failed".
- The nav Queue badge now updates itself (it polls a small count endpoint) instead of being baked in at page load — so it can't sit reading "1" beside an empty Queue after a job finished while you were on another page.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-23

**Data-safety polish**

- Migrating in place into a destination that's short on space is now blocked before anything moves, the same way the CLI already refused it — a move that runs out mid-way would leave your library half-relocated. Tick "proceed even if low on space" on the Migrate screen to override deliberately. The copy mode (the default) still only warns, since it leaves your originals intact.
- The migration space preview now counts the cover art, booklets, and `.cue`/`.log` sidecars that get carried alongside the audio, so the estimate matches what the copy actually writes — previously a library with large booklets could see an estimate that was too low, and an in-place move could read "0 bytes" while still copying art.
- When a parked album finally imports on a retry, any non-audio companions it left behind (booklets, scans, cover art) are now moved somewhere safe instead of being deleted with the staging folder — the same protection the upgrade path already had.

**Correctness**

- An artist's discography no longer stops paginating early if Qobuz returns a page with a few malformed entries mixed in, which could silently hide some of that artist's albums during a scan.
- Fuzzy-match thresholds set via the environment are clamped to their valid 0–1 range, so a typo like `CONSOLIDATE_THRESH=-1` can't quietly turn duplicate cleanup into "match everything."
- The gap-fill "will downsample to…" note now respects your download-quality tier — at CD-lossless it no longer promises a downsample that won't happen.
- Saved Qobuz credentials are now flushed to disk durably, matching the web-login credential write, so a crash right after saving can't roll back a token the UI reported as saved.
- The hidden/single-album store is now safe against two processes writing it at once (a web dismissal during a CLI hand-off), via a cross-process lock and unique temp files.

**Setup, docs, and release polish**

- `compose.yaml` now forwards the documented `.env` knobs that it previously dropped — `WEB_AUTH_PASSWORD_FILE`, the free-space floor, the repair cache/pacing settings, beets path/plugin overrides, and the live-album filter — so setting them in `.env` actually takes effect.
- New `WEB_BIND` controls the host interface the UI is published on; set `WEB_BIND=127.0.0.1` to keep it off the LAN. (The old advice to set `WEB_HOST=127.0.0.1` was wrong for Docker — that's the in-container bind.)
- New releases are described everywhere as flagged/badged for review rather than "pre-ticked": the review screen leaves them un-ticked so one click can't queue a whole list.
- Configuration docs now state the real new-release and catalog-cache defaults, clarify that Settings covers the common behaviour knobs while advanced ones stay in `.env`/Compose, and fix the migration-results filename, lock-handoff, and CLI-container wording. The Docker image's license metadata now reflects the third-party (GPL) tools it bundles, and the release smoke test verifies the compiled stylesheet is actually served.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-23

**New-release check needs a baseline first**

- A new-release check compares your artists' Qobuz catalogs against a baseline that a full library scan builds, so it now needs one first. Until your first full scan finishes, "Check for new releases" is disabled (with a note saying why) and a direct request is refused — instead of crawling to an empty baseline, surfacing nothing, and marking the baseline "done," which previously left an interrupted library scan unable to resume. The automatic daily check likewise waits behind an interrupted scan you're resuming.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-23

**Reviews no longer pile up**

- Re-running a scan — repair, library gap-fill, upgrade, or downsample — replaces its earlier pending review instead of stacking a second one. A parked review doesn't clear itself, so without this a repeat scan left a duplicate "N candidates" review sitting on the dashboard every time.

**"New releases" means actually new**

- The new-release check flags an album when it appears in an artist's catalog and you don't own it — including an old album Qobuz only just added, which is genuinely new to you. The fix is in keeping the baseline trustworthy so this can't dump your back-catalog: a catalog bigger than the fetch limit is recorded but not diffed (its order isn't stable run to run), the baseline grows by union instead of being overwritten, and when the catalog fetch limit itself grows the check re-baselines once rather than treating the newly-visible older albums as fresh arrivals. Candidates default to un-ticked, so a review never queues a pile of downloads in one tap.

**Repair scan — cleaner live activity**

- A whole-library repair scan now shows its progress as a single status line under the progress bar — `Scanning "<artist>" · N albums · M flagged`, refreshing a couple of times a second — instead of appending a "still scanning…" line to the activity log every few seconds. The activity log now lists only flagged albums (the actual findings), and a finished scan no longer keeps hundreds of heartbeat lines.

**Repair runs on one page**

- A repair scan now stays on the Repair page from start to finish — scanning, reviewing the flagged albums, and the repair itself all happen there and update live, instead of handing you off to a separate job page partway through. A parked review is no longer reachable only behind a "Start scan" button that would have discarded it.

**Jobs say what they're doing**

- A queued job now tells you what it's waiting behind instead of a bare "Queued"; a run that works through many albums keeps its progress on "album 3 of 16" rather than resetting to 1 of 1 for each one; and the Upgrade, Downsample, and Lyrics pages show when they last ran, so a fresh visit isn't indistinguishable from never having run.

**Safety fixes**

- Undo on a single-track grab can no longer remove a same-numbered track from a different disc of a multi-disc album. A flood of failed logins can no longer lock the admin out — a request that already carries a valid session skips the limit — and an unreadable credentials file now fails closed instead of re-opening first-run setup. A library migration to a destination short on free space no longer starts an unattended run that would relocate files until it ran out.
- Upgrading an album no longer discards its booklets, scans, `.cue`/`.log`, or hand-placed cover art: the bulk and web upgrade paths now carry those companions into the rebuilt folder before clearing the backup, matching the single-album path. Consolidating duplicate folders moves the overlapping tracks to a recoverable backup rather than deleting them outright, so a mistaken match can be undone. A repair no longer removes a pre-existing album folder it failed to recognise before refilling. And a near-full disk now stops the download queue cleanly and keeps the rest for a retry, instead of failing each album in turn.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-21

The repair scan, rebuilt — it catches more, runs far faster, and shows what it's doing — plus reliability and safety fixes from a follow-up audit. The one changed default: the unusable 320 kbps tier is gone.

**Repair catches truncated files that still play**

- The whole-library repair scan now checks every track's length against its exact Qobuz recording, not only files that look obviously small. A track cut short at a frame boundary, with its FLAC header rewritten to the shorter length, decodes cleanly and passes the size check — so the old sweep marked it intact and moved on, and a genuinely damaged album could scan green. Every ISRC-tagged track is now duration-verified (the command-line sweep too).

**Faster, and re-scans skip the network**

- The sweep now checks several artists at once instead of plodding one at a time, so the first scan of a large library is several times quicker. The slow part is the per-track Qobuz lookup, and that's now cached: a re-scan — and any album that shares a track's ISRC — skips the network round trip. The files themselves are still decode-tested fresh on every scan, so a re-scan still catches corruption that has appeared since the last one rather than trusting an old verdict. Set `REPAIR_CACHE_ENABLED=false` to skip the lookup cache, or `REPAIR_CACHE_TTL_DAYS` to change how often a cached lookup re-verifies against Qobuz.

**The repair scan shows what it's doing**

- A clean library prints nothing for long stretches — only problems are listed — which used to read as a hang on "Waiting for output…". The scan now shows a live "now checking" line, a periodic "still scanning — checked N albums…" heartbeat, and an elapsed clock, with the activity log open by default, so a long scan visibly works instead of looking frozen.

**Fresh downloads are double-checked**

- After an album finishes downloading, its track lengths are re-checked against Qobuz. The downloader already discards tracks that won't decode, but a clean truncation (decodes fine, header rewritten short) could slip past that — now it's caught right after the download with a note to repair it, instead of waiting to be found by a later scan.

**Backups verify contents, not just size**

- Cross-filesystem backup, restore, and gap-fill now verify the copy by hashing its contents before the original is deleted, instead of trusting a matching file count and total byte size. A same-size corruption — a transfer glitch, or a partial write re-padded back to length — used to pass the size check, and the source was then removed, leaving the damaged copy as the only one. The copy is now compared byte-for-byte and any mismatch aborts the operation with the original left untouched.

**Download quality**

- The 320 kbps MP3 tier is removed. The pipeline is FLAC-only and the post-download cleanup discards any non-FLAC file, so choosing that tier downloaded each track and then deleted it — the setting silently fetched nothing. It's gone from Settings and the docs, and an existing `STREAMRIP_QUALITY=1` is now coerced to CD lossless (the smallest lossless tier) with a clear message rather than passed straight through.

**Container runs as the user you asked for**

- A non-numeric `PUID`/`PGID` (a typo) used to log a warning and then silently run the container as root, defeating the non-root isolation. It now refuses to start; running as root requires the explicit, valid pair `PUID=0 PGID=0`.

**Review selection matches the server**

- Select-all and the per-artist select now tick boxes only after the server confirms each save. A failed save used to leave boxes ticked while the server held none, so approval acted on a selection you never really made; a failure now flags the affected boxes and leaves the rest alone so you can retry.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-20

Quality-of-life and reliability improvements across search, scanning, and the web UI.

**Search & scanning**

- Search returns more results, so big artists surface properly.
- Whole-library scans now show the full set instead of capping the list, and prolific artists are no longer cut short.
- Artists sort by name ignoring a leading "The"/"A"/"An" (so "The Beatles" files under B).

**Web UI**

- The Search page lays out correctly on narrow phone screens.
- Snappier under load, plus a few list/pagination edges tidied up.

**Under the hood**

- A range of correctness and reliability fixes across downloads and library maintenance, plus tighter build checks.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-18

Strengthens the library repair scan so it can no longer report a corrupt file as intact, plus two smaller correctness fixes. No changed defaults.

**Repair scan**

- The whole-library repair scan now decode-tests every FLAC instead of trusting its size and STREAMINFO header. A file with frame-CRC damage or a zeroed-out middle keeps its original size and reported duration, so the old size-and-header check passed it as "verified intact" and the scan reported no damage. Every file is now run through `flac -t` locally (no network): a clean file still costs no Qobuz call, a file that won't decode is surfaced and refilled, and when the `flac` tool is missing a file is counted "unverified" rather than silently "ok". The scan summary now reports what was actually decode-verified.

**Offline page**

- The offline page's Retry button works again. It loaded a small script that was never shipped in the image, so the button did nothing; it is now a plain link that still works while the service worker is serving the page.

**Dismissed-album list**

- A corrupt hidden-albums file is now moved aside to a `.corrupt` copy with a warning instead of being silently overwritten by the next dismissal. Previously one unreadable read returned an empty list and the next hide or restore wrote a fresh file over it, destroying a dismissed-album list curated over weeks with no trace.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-13

Bugfix release. All seventeen changes are fixes to edge cases found by an exhaustive post-release audit — no new features, no changed defaults.

**Backup safety**

- The age sweep now proves each track in an upgrade backup is actually back at its origin path — same relative filename, at least as many bytes — before reaping the backup. File-count matching was fooled when a gap-fill or other operation added a different file to the origin while one of the backup's own tracks was still missing there. Previously that could silently destroy the only surviving copy of the unreturned track.
- An upgrade backup kept because the re-rip couldn't be verified as complete (e.g. a truncated-but-decodable track shrank the playtime) now gets an explicit keep-marker. A same-count, larger hi-res re-rip could look redundant by bytes alone and be reaped on the next sweep; the marker stops that.
- The beets import override now always forces `move: yes`. A user beets config with `copy: yes` was silently leaving every newly-downloaded album in staging, which the pipeline's success check read as "import failed" and parked.
- Retrying parked albums now checks whether the audio actually left disk before removing the parking entry. A beets run that exits 0 while skipping a library duplicate (under `duplicate_action: skip`) used to trigger cleanup on the strength of the exit code alone, deleting the only copy.

**Single-track grab and undo**

- Grabbing the last missing track of an album now clears the "grabbed single" mark an earlier partial grab may have left. Without this the album's artist stayed hidden from bulk scans and the new-release check even after you completed the album.
- The upgrade walk now keys the "skip grabbed singles" check on the Qobuz artist name, not the folder name. A folder called "Beatles" where Qobuz says "The Beatles" was leaking the grabbed single back into upgrade candidates.
- The single-track undo now takes the cross-process run lock before deleting any files or touching the beets database.
- The undo track-match now uses the `tracknumber` field (the one `read_album_dir` actually writes). Also, two tracks with no ISRC and no track number on record can no longer accidentally match each other and delete the wrong file.

**Consolidation and repair**

- Consolidation stops immediately under `--dry-run` — it deletes overlapping tracks, so letting it run was a dry-run violation.
- Repair stops under `--dry-run` before moving any files aside, for the same reason: repair moves the truncated originals out of the way before re-ripping, so an interrupt could have stranded them.
- A sibling FLAC whose quality can't be read (broken STREAMINFO or no title tag) now shows as "quality unreadable" and requires the same explicit DELETE confirmation as a track that's clearly better quality. Previously it was silently counted as safe to delete.

**Web and CLI polish**

- The settings page keeps the token you just typed in the (masked) field when Qobuz rejects it, so you can fix a paste slip without re-entering the whole thing.
- Pasting an album URL into Tracks mode now shows a clear "that's an album URL — switch to Albums" message instead of a silent empty result.
- An interrupted repair scan now tells you to start the repair scan again (which resumes from the checkpoint), not the library scan.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

- **Get one song.** Search has a Tracks mode and a *Get track* button that pulls a single track instead of the whole album. It lands in the right `Artist/Album (Year)/` folder over the same per-track path repair uses — never a full-album rip — and the partial folder it leaves is recorded so the bulk scans don't nag you to finish that album. An artist you own only a grabbed sample by isn't read as one you're collecting, so their back catalogue stays out of the scans and the new-release check too. If the grabbed track was the album's last missing one you now own the whole thing and it's filed as a normal complete album; finishing the album the usual way later clears the mark the same way. Asking for a track you already have downloads nothing. The Upgrade walk leaves grabbed singles alone unless you set `UPGRADE_SINGLES_ENABLED`. A finished grab carries an **Undo** that deletes the track, drops its beets row, clears the mark, and removes the folder if the grab created it and it's now empty.
- Two quick retries of the same album can no longer double-queue it — retry now re-checks for a job already touching that album under the submit lock, the same way the download route does.
- The downsample step caps the ffmpeg encode at ten minutes, so a track on a hung NFS or FUSE mount fails with a clear message and leaves the original untouched instead of pinning a worker forever.
- Behind a reverse proxy the entrypoint passes `--proxy-headers` and honours `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`, so the login rate-limiter sees each client's real address instead of the proxy's and stops locking everyone out at once.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-05

First public release. Major additions included:

- **Migrate** mode turns an existing, messy or half-tagged collection into the `Artist/Album (Year)/` layout the rest of the tool expects. It reads each file's tags first and can fall back to AcoustID fingerprinting; it copies by default, so the originals are never touched, and anything it can't place confidently is left alone and listed in a manifest.
- ISRC-anchored **repair** now snapshots a truncated file's tags before it goes and restores them onto the refilled track, and backs up the source by ISRC before replacing it — a crash mid-refill can no longer strand a track.
- The awaiting-review list pages by artist and keeps its selection on the server, so approving thousands of candidates no longer rides on form state.
- Lyric state and the retry manifest are locked across processes; rejected staging files are quarantined instead of silently left in place.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-27

- A corrupt fetch-log line can no longer 500 the dashboard.
- `Retry-After: 0` from Qobuz is honoured instead of being treated as no header.
- An unrecognised `STREAMRIP_QUALITY` warns loudly rather than defaulting to the most permissive cap.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-21

- **Check for new releases** — across the whole library or one artist — compares each artist's current Qobuz catalogue against what you've seen and surfaces only what's genuinely new, flagged for review. It reads the catalogue listing alone, so it's about one API call per artist.
- On-disk caches (album fetches, parsed FLAC tags keyed on path+mtime+size, and artist catalogues with a TTL) turn a re-scan of an unchanged library into seconds instead of minutes.
- Jobs survive a container restart: an awaiting-review list comes back, and an interrupted job returns marked as such with a retry hint instead of vanishing.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-30

- Multi-disc folders detect disc numbers for non-FLAC tracks.
- Two upgrade-backup restore edges (equal-byte and empty-backup-dir) no longer block automatic recovery.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-28

- **Upgrade** mode re-rips albums Qobuz can now serve at a higher quality, backing up the originals first.
- **Downsample** mode shrinks hi-res FLACs above CD rate to 44.1/48 kHz, each verified to decode cleanly before it replaces the original.
- **Repair** finds truncated or short FLACs and refills the exact missing tracks by ISRC, leaving good files untouched.
- **Lyrics** mode backfills synced lyrics across tracks already on disk.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-03

- The dashboard's stale-token banner flips the moment the API rejects the token, instead of only checking at startup.
- Cancelling a queued download stops cleanly instead of leaving a half-finished album to be swept into a later import.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-26

- A web UI (FastAPI) for searching, downloading and watching jobs stream their log live, alongside the existing CLI.
- A crash-safe persistent download queue that resumes after a restart, with a per-run lock so two instances can't fight over the same library.
- Whole-library and per-artist gap scans that list every missing album.
- Ships as a multi-stage Docker image with a compose stack.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-29

- First working version: download a single Qobuz album or a whole artist, scan a local library to know what's already there, and import cleanly with beets so only the genuinely missing tracks are fetched.
