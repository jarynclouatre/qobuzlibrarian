"""Persistent cache of ``get_album`` responses, keyed on album id.

A Qobuz album's metadata and track list don't change, so a fetched album is safe
to keep indefinitely. Library scans call ``get_album`` once per owned album to
materialise its track list (``get_artist_albums`` returns counts, not items), and
that per-album call is the dominant API cost of a scan. Serving it from a local
SQLite lookup turns a re-scan of an unchanged library from minutes of round-trips
into milliseconds.

SQLite (not one big JSON) so a few thousand albums are written incrementally and
read by id without rewriting the whole file, and so a scan's parallel workers can
each hold their own connection. Set ``ALBUM_CACHE_ENABLED=false`` to turn it off;
delete the db file to force a full refresh.
