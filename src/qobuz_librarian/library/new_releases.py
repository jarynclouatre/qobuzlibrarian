"""State for the new-release quickscan.

The quickscan compares each library artist's current Qobuz catalog against the
album ids recorded here from the last check; anything new the user doesn't own
and hasn't hidden is a new release. The first check of an artist records only a
baseline (so the back catalogue isn't dumped as "new") — later checks surface
the difference. ``last_run`` lets the dashboard throttle the automatic check.
