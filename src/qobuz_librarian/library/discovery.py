"""The one engine behind "given an artist, what am I missing?".

Both faces call this: the CLI artist mode wraps it in terminal prompts, the web
scans turn its result into review candidates. Neither computes matching logic of
its own any more, so a fix lands once and the two can't drift.

The answer is built in two passes, because the right question differs for albums
you own versus albums you don't:

  Pass A — disk walk. For every folder you own under the artist, match it to the
    Qobuz edition that folder actually is and compare track-for-track. This is
    what catches gaps accurately, including in deluxe/anniversary editions and in
    singles the catalog-level filters drop.
  Pass B — catalog walk. Everything in the artist's catalog that Pass A didn't
    already account for, isn't owned under another folder, and isn't dismissed,
    surfaces as a fully-missing album.

`resolve_artist` lives here too: it's the shared artist matcher (article-aware,
prefers the deepest catalog over a bare-name twin, cached to disk).
