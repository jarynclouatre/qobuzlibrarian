"""On-disk cache of Qobuz ISRC→track lookups — the one network cost of a repair scan.

A repair scan resolves every track to its exact Qobuz recording by ISRC to
compare durations, and that lookup (one search per track) is both the slow part
and the only part that touches the network. An ISRC names a recording for good,
so the result is safe to remember: a re-scan, and any album that shares the same
ISRC, skips the lookup. The file itself is still decode-tested fresh on every
scan, so corruption that turns up on disk later is always caught — only the
network round trip is cached, never a verdict about a file.

An entry is reused while it is younger than ``REPAIR_CACHE_TTL_DAYS`` so a
remembered track still re-checks against Qobuz that often, in case its catalogue
entry changed; a TTL of 0 keeps entries until the db is deleted. Only a positive
hit is stored — a lookup that found nothing (a transient outage, a delisted
track) is never cached, so a hiccup can't freeze a "no match" in place. Set
``REPAIR_CACHE_ENABLED=false`` to disable; delete the db to drop everything.
