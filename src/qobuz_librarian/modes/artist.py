"""Artist mode — two-step run for one artist.

  Step 1 — Gap fill: walk every album you own by this artist and offer to
           download the missing tracks of each.
  Step 2 — Missing albums: list everything on Qobuz by this artist you
           don't have, and offer to download.

The matching itself — which folder is which Qobuz edition, what's missing,
what's a false match — lives in library.discovery, the one engine the web
scans share. This module is the terminal face: prompts, sibling cleanup, the
two-step presentation.
