# Enforce the streamrip settings the librarian depends on, every boot. These

# across image rebuilds, so a config written by an older build is brought into
# line rather than left stale. Best-effort: a read-only /config leaves the
# value alone and the writability check below explains why.
#   downloads_enabled=false  — its downloads.db otherwise blocks re-download of
#     any track the user removed by hand. The ^anchor in the key match leaves
#     failed_downloads_enabled untouched.
#   add_singles_to_folder=true — per-track gap-fill must land each track in its
#     own folder, or beets routes multiple albums into one on-disk folder.
#   download_booklets=false — the librarian imports audio only; a fetched
#     booklet PDF never lands in the library, just clutters /staging and
#     inflates the leftover count that can abort a --yes run.
#   check_for_updates=false — streamrip is pinned into the image, so its
#     "a new version is available" notice can't be acted on; turning it off
#     also drops a PyPI request from every download.
